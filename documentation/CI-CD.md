# CI/CD Updated: 05/02/2022

## Continuous Intergration 
Github will be used to store our code so that anyone can access it 
The main branch will hold the stable build of that project and likey means that the code the [Aidan folder](/Aidan/Aidan.uproject) is able to be builed and run. This is also the code that is use to build the package to make a lanchable exe file, a new working version of the project should be taged and when ready a github relase should be made from a tag.

when working on the project make a new branch 

A similar setup will be used for the Revit Add-on, where the main branch will be the current stable build that can be used with the Revit Architecure software. 

## Continuous Delivery

For continous delivery, we will be purposely not working on this aspect of CI/CD for our MVP. This is due to the immense difficulty of implementing CI/CD in our type of project. We do not have the luxury of working for weeks on launchers for both the Revit exporter and Unreal importer.

If a future team would like to work on this aspect of Aidan, that would be a boon to the project.
