## About Aidan
This project started as the name Stadia by Robert and Eric Pogue. They created a Interactive Rendering Tool within Unity that allowed architects to see their renders from Revit in real time without the limit of hardware. This project was very successful and sold commercially for awhile until it was abandoned a few years ago. Eric Pogue decided to bring the project back to life in a stronger 3D engine so that is where Unreal Engine 4 comes in. We are attempting to rebuild this project but with the full ability to run at build time (lighting, materials, and meshes). As the project has evolved, Aidan has moved onto the powerful FBX file format.

## Services Used
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) - Host FBX files
- [Unreal Engine 4(UE4)](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) - Render Engine
- [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) - Architects 3D Modeling Tool
- [GitHub](https://github.com) - Helps share the code with each of the group members and ensure everone is on the same page

## Important Files
- TO BE ADDED

## Current Progress
- Receive both the Revit exporter and Unreal importer
- Run and execute the exporter.
- Run the lastest Unreal project build.
- Using the automatic file detection, load the mesh.
- The loaded mesh will have collision, basic lighting, and basic dev texturing at a reasonable framerate.

## To-Do
- Add texture exportation to Revit exporter.
- Add a way for doors to work.
- Create launchers for the exporter and importer.
