Team Minimum Value Product

The MVP for AIR (Aiden Interactive Rendering), set to be delivered by the end of our 4th sprint, is to generally focus on constructing a runtime Revit exporter and Unreal importer for the FBX 3D file format. By constructing this importer and exporter pair, we seek to make Revit environments able to be represented in Unreal. With a new file format being chosen for AIR, much of the previous work completed on this software will not be able to be reused. This MVP seeks to create a very simple scene to simplify the initial importation process. There is a myriad of additional features that can be added to AIR after this goal has been met, such as proper object collision, a lighting solution, proper texturing of all surfaces, the use of cloud computing to increase the potential fidelity, and more. These additions will improve the product but will slow down the development of our core goal: to provide a real-time walkthrough capability to Revit models. While it would be great to continue the work done by the previous team, the need for a modern and popular 3D file format is simply too great for the future of this project.
              
The FBX file format has been chosen because Unreal supports FBX importation natively and Revit supports FBX exportation natively. During our research, multiple run-time FBX importers for Unreal were discovered which could be used for our purposes. While these tools exist, it is not clear at this time whether they can be used for this software. Nevertheless, even non-runtime support for FBX should streamline our implementation of an FBX importer and exporter. While the Collada file format was considered, the native support for FBX in Unreal and Revit is too useful to ignore.
              
By allowing customers to create an interactively rendered scene imported from Revit to Unreal, we will have access to the maximum amount of feedback in the least amount of effort. With any less work, customers would not be able to use their projects in AIR in real time and feedback would be severely limited. We will of course receive feedback asking for textures and lighting, but the simple representation of Revit models in a real-time 3D space allows for very simple Unreal solutions to be applied to AIR. This MVP sees the implementation of adding a physical human analog to walk through the imported model as being non-critical for gaining maximum feedback. A free-floating controllable camera will be sufficient for our initial purposes. Once this MVP has been achieved, making the environment even roughly traversable will be quite easy.
              
By producing the very core of the project for this MVP, we ensure that all feedback we receive will pertain to how we can make the core of this project better. Because this team does not include anyone familiar with Revit and using Revit to create architectural solutions, many possible issues with our design plan can only be found through a usable release and consumer feedback. After achieving this MVP, we can start moving towards remedying user issues simultaneously while we improve fidelity and usability. To achieve this goal, we plan on using cloud computing solutions for rendering and processing. This way, we can generate highly detailed environments without having to worry about our consumerâ€™s hardware limitations. This would also allow customers to present and examine designs from most machines with an internet connection. As we move forward, this MVP may evolve based on new information or unique perspectives.
