Team Minimum Value Product

A minimum viable product is described as a version of a product that allows team members to maximize learning about customers with the least effort. An MVP should be a product that *could* stand alone, if need be, but can or will be improved upon in the future. The importance of an MVP for a team is acknowledging the short-term goal that will bring in some value. Establishing an MVP allows developers to focus on tools and systems that users and customers need instead of what they may want but is unnecessary to the completion of the project. Also, if an MVP has value with just the core principles of the project, this is an easy way to validate concepts and distinguish between the practicality of projects and help managers or development teams to decide on which ideas to pursue. With regards to Aidan Interactive Rendering, I believe that an MVP for this project would be a version that produces interactive rendering through Unreal Engine (excluding Revit export functionality).

In a minimum viable product version of AIR (Aidan Interactive Rendering), the focus would be on achieving cloud computational power, and Unreal Engine’s graphical production. I describe this as an MVP because it may operate from specific models that developers hard code in, but doesn’t necessarily possess extra functionality, such as communicating with Revit for architectural designs or doing computations in the cloud. This does achieve status as a product, however, because independently it can provide interactive renderings, however, it doesn’t contain extra enhancements that cloud computing will provide or a larger pool of designs that Revit can achieve.

The next step for this MVP would be utilizing cloud computational power to enhance the project.  This will enable AIR to be hosted and render projects in the cloud.  Functionality and efficiency will both be improved because adding or changing data files will not require a reload of the entire project or engine.  Utilizing the cloud is the optimal choice because the alternative, rendering in Unreal, could create issues such as slow run-time because of file size, or even having to reinstall the engine because of changes to data files.  Unreal possesses many systems that enable connectivity to resources in the cloud, such as pixel stream, that allow developers to off-load necessary rendering or computation.

This MVP can be achieved by utilizing Unreal Engine’s unique systems, animations, shading, and lighting systems to create a completely interactive environment. The shader systems in Unreal are unique in the way they are compiled. The shaders are compiled with a unique case for all materials and meshes, preparing for all possible outcomes, which offers greater interactivity for users as lighting and shading change inside of the Aidan Interactive Rendering designs. Also, shaders are applied only when they become available, which will allow greater detail in graphics without heavy requirements on system specifications.

The MVP can be delivered by the end of the 4th sprint. Utilizing the capabilities of Unreal Engine, interactive environments will be able to be rendered and explored by the user. This also allows 8 weeks to develop functionally for computing rendering processes in the cloud, as well as including Revit architectural designs in building new environments.  

Overall, MVPs play an integral role in planning large-scale projects and allow developers to remove unnecessary or trivial features to validate the core foundations of a project. MVPs are generally built very quickly, this way validation occurs with little effort, and not much is lost if a project is retired. My personal belief is that a good MVP candidate for AIR would be a program in Unreal that creates interactive environments, then can later be built upon with Revit and cloud computing functionality.
